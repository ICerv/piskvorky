# ‚≠ï‚ùå Tic Tac Toe with AI Player ‚ùå‚≠ï

This project is an implementation of the ‚≠ï‚ùåTic Tac Toe‚ùå‚≠ï game using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## Functionalities

1. **Intro Page**: The intro page provides a description of the Tic Tac Toe game and offers links to the game rules and the option to start playing.
2. **Game Page**: Clicking the "Start Playing" button navigates to the game page. Here, the game board is represented by buttons (`<button>`) as individual cells. An animation is used for smooth transition between pages.
3. **Player Turns**: Players are represented by the symbols "o" and "x". The player's turn is updated after each move.
4. **Player Moves**: Clicking on an empty cell allows the player to make a move, and the corresponding cell is marked with the player's symbol.
5. **Winning and Draw Validation**: After each move, the game checks if a player has won (created a winning sequence) or if the game has resulted in a draw. In such cases, a corresponding message is displayed, and the game is restarted.
6. **AI Player**: If the current player is "x", an AI player is used to calculate and make moves. The AI player utilizes an API (`https://piskvorky.czechitas-podklady.cz/api/suggest-next-move`) to suggest the next move. ü§ñ
7. **Control Buttons**: The game page includes control buttons for returning to the intro page and restarting the game. These buttons are animated to change their appearance on mouse hover. ‚è™üîÑ

The entire project is divided into two pages: the intro page (`index.html`) and the game page (`game.html`). Each page has its own HTML and CSS code. Additionally, an external JavaScript file `game.js` is used, which contains the game logic and communication with the AI player.

The project is developed with a focus on responsiveness to adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Animations and transitions are utilized to enhance user interaction and improve the overall visual experience.
